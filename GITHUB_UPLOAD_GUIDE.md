# 🚀 How to Upload Your Project to GitHub

Since Git is not currently installed on your computer, I've created a special automation script for you.

## Step 1: Install Git (Required)

1.  Download Git from: **[https://git-scm.com/download/win](https://git-scm.com/download/win)**
2.  Run the installer.
3.  **Click "Next"** through all the options (the default settings are fine).
4.  **Important:** Wait for the installation to finish.

## Step 2: Run the Upload Script

I've created a file named **`upload_to_github.bat`** in your project folder.

1.  Open your project folder: `c:\xampp\htdocs\HOUSE RENT`
2.  Double-click on **`upload_to_github.bat`**

## What will happen?

The script will automatically:
1.  Initialize Git for your project.
2.  Create a `house-rent` repository on your GitHub account (`asif-newera`).
3.  Add all your files.
4.  Upload everything to GitHub.

## That's it!

Once the script finishes, your project will be live at:
**[https://github.com/asif-newera/house-rent](https://github.com/asif-newera/house-rent)**
