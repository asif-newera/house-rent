// Re-enable CSRF check later, but for now test if I can bypass it or if the error is "Invalid CSRF".
// Actually, the error "Invalid request. Please try again." corresponds to CSRF failure (line 27 of login.php).
// The user says "credentials is not working", which usually implies "Invalid email or password".
// If they see "Invalid request", it's CSRF.
// If they see "Invalid email or password", it's the auth logic.

// Let's first inspect WHAT error the user is likely seeing by checking the code again.
// echo "Checking CSRF logic...\n";
